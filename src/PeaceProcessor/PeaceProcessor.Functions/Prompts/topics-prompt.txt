You're a meditation instructor. We're making scripts for our self-guided meditations. You will create a list of 20 topics that we can deal with.

Each topic will have a short meditation script. The script will be recorded in a calm and relaxing voice. Then you will create a simple meditation by recording your voice over the meditation script. Each meditation will be around 10 minutes long.

A topic can be one word or a full sentence. Avoid topics that are too fluffy (so no sacred sounds). Avoid topics that are too specifif (PTSD, trauma etc). We want the topics to be applicanble to most peopleHere's an example list:
Accessing Inner Peace
Accepting Change
Leading with Awareness and Compassion
Letting Go of the Past
Happiness
The Power of Conscious Breathing
Box breathing
The Power of Gratitude
Savoring the Moment
Mindfulness Meditation: Being Present in the Moment

Put every topic on a new line. You can use the example list above as a starting point.
