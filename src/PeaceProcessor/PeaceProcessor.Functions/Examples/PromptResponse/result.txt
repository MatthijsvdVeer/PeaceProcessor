Welcome, dear friend. I invite you to find a comfortable position, whether that's sitting on the ground, on a chair, or perhaps on a pillow. You may also wish to lie down. Rest your hands gently in your lap. Feel your body settling into this position. <BREAK10>\n\nLet's start with focusing on our breath. Take a slow and deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then release it gently through your mouth. <BREAK10> Again, inhale deeply through your nose... And slowly exhale through your mouth. <BREAK10> \n\nOne more time, breathe in... And breathe out. <BREAK20> \n\nFeel the rhythm of your breath. Let your thoughts come and go, like clouds drifting across the sky. Let your focus remain on your breath. <BREAK30> \n\nNow we are going to shift our focus slightly. \n\nKeep your eyes gently closed, and imagine a warm, glowing light in your heart. This light represents happiness. Allow this light to expand with every breath you take. <BREAK20> \n\nAs you continue to breathe, you notice this light grow larger, illuminating your entire body from within. The light is warm and comforting, filling you with a sense of peace and joy. <BREAK30> \n\nNow, imagine any stress, worry, or tension you might be carrying as a shadow within your body. As you breathe, imagine the light within you is gently touching these shadows. <BREAK20>\n\nWith each exhale, the shadows are getting smaller, dimming as the light of happiness grows brighter. Breathe in peace, breathe out stress. <BREAK10> Repeat this, breathe in peace… and breathe out stress. <BREAK20> \n\nImagine your stress as a smoky cloud being released from your body with each exhale. This cloud gets lighter and thinner with each breath. <BREAK30> \n\nNow, bring your focus back to the light of happiness within you. Feel it pulsating with each heartbeat, spreading warmth, and joy throughout your body. <BREAK20> \n\nRemember, this light is always within you. You can access it anytime you need to replace stress and tension with peace and happiness. <BREAK40> \n\nFinally, bring your focus back to your breath. Notice its rhythm, the rise and fall of your chest. <BREAK20> \n\nWhen you're ready, gently wiggle your fingers and toes, bringing awareness back to your body. Open your eyes slowly, carry this peaceful feeling and light of happiness with you as you move forward in your day. \n\nThank you for sharing this time with me, dear student. I look forward to our next meditation session.
